# CodeTutorGPT

This project is an interactive programming language tutor, designed to teach users a language through a series of interactive lessons. The AI tutor provides explanations, examples, and tasks for users to complete in order to gain a deeper understanding of the language. The project's folder structure, scripts, and files are outlined below.
