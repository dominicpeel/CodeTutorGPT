# CodeTutorGPT

This project is an interactive programming language tutor, designed to teach users a language through a series of interactive lessons. The AI tutor provides explanations, examples, and tasks for users to complete in order to gain a deeper understanding of the language. The project's folder structure, scripts, and files are outlined below.

The main.py script monitors for changes to the lesson.c file, automatically compiling and running and providing the result to the OpenAI API for feedback.
